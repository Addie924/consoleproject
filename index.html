    <h1>Visual Code Studio</h1>
    <p>Visual Code Studio is a website that lets you code websites yourself with HTML, CSS, JS, and other languages. It has a cool auto-complete feature, whch gives you a dropdown menu of tags and code-functions that contain what you have written. I started using it recently. It is developed by Microsoft.</p>
    <p>The console is a half-screen that you can visit by right-clicking on any website, selecting inspect, and using the top-navigation to go to console. The system console, computer console, root console, operator's console, or simply console is the text entry and display device for system administration messages, particularly those from the BIOS or boot loader, the kernel, from the init system and from the system logger.</p>
